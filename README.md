# Inofficial Fork of ZMK

This is an inofficial fork of [ZMK](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/). This main branch tracks the original main branch except for this `README.md`. I try to keep the following branches up to date that might be of interest to you:

* `devel-adaptive`: my adaptive keys aka antecedent morph behavior patch

* `devel-retrotap`: Nick Conway's [retrotap behavior](https://github.com/nickconway/zmk/tree/retro-tap-binding) patch, rebased to the current main.

* `devel-pointers`: [PR 2027](https://github.com/zmkfirmware/zmk/pull/2027), rebased to the current main.

* `devel-yackboard`: the antecedent morph and retrotap behavior patches and the definition of my personal key board, the
  [Yackboard v1](https://gitlab.com/voidyourwarranty/yackboard).

The following is the original README.
